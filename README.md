# Clustering Algorithms in Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains theoretical explanations and practical implementations of various clustering algorithms in machine learning. The implementations are provided as Jupyter notebooks.

## 📂 Files in This Repository

### 1. **Clustering\_Theoretical\_Questions.ipynb**

- Contains theoretical explanations of clustering concepts, including:
  - K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering
  - Evaluation Metrics like Silhouette Score and Inertia
  - Feature Scaling Importance
  - Linkage Criteria in Hierarchical Clustering

### 2. **Clustering\_Practical\_Implementation.ipynb**

- Hands-on implementation of clustering algorithms using Python & Scikit-Learn
- Practical tasks include:
  - Generating synthetic data (make\_blobs, make\_moons, make\_circles)
  - Applying K-Means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering
  - Visualizing clusters using scatter plots, PCA, and t-SNE
  - Evaluating models with Silhouette Scores and Inertia

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Running the Notebooks

Use Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to execute the code:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## 📊 Visualizations Included

- Scatter plots for cluster representation
- Dendrograms for hierarchical clustering
- 3D scatter plots for PCA-based clustering visualization

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Scikit-Learn** (for clustering algorithms)
- **t-SNE & PCA** (for dimensionality reduction)
